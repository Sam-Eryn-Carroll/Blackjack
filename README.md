This is a very basic version of the game blackjack or twenty-one. The goal of the game is to get to 21 but not over. Blackjack orginally called Vingt-Un aka twenty-one, first refrenced in writing by Miguel de Carvantes in 1613 and was played with a baraja deck. The first actual record of the game wasn't until 1768 in France and 1770 - 1790. But the first record rules never appeared till 1800. The english version of Vingt-Un later became an american variant called blackjack.
